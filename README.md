To-Do List Web Application

Develop a web application that allows users to create and manage daily task lists.

The To-Do List should provide the following functionality:

• Task Creation – users can add new tasks to the list.
• Task Deletion – users can remove tasks that are no longer needed.
• Task Completion – users can mark tasks as completed.
• Persistent Storage – all tasks should be saved using localStorage, so data remains available after the page is refreshed.
